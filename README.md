# Alcoholic EEG Signal Classification
 
This is a project for my final year thesis, I compare two feature extraction method, that is RWB that is proposed [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8168473), and Bispectrum with filter that is proposed [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/10/2/63), to classify EEG signal of an alcoholic.

For the more complete specification of the environment I use, you can refer to [this yaml file](https://github.com/Fulkyhariz/EEG-Alcohol-Classification/blob/main/Environment.yaml), you can also directly import it to create new anaconda environment
